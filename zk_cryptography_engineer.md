# ZK/Cryptography Engineer @ powdr labs

*powdr* is a language and compiler framework designed to aid development of zkVMs and ZK proof generation. It consists of a modular stack with an architecture that is agnostic to both frontend languages and backend ZK proof systems. *powdr* is fully FOSS and built in the open.
